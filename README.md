# LSTM model for predicting stock prices

In this project I built a recurrent neural network model to predict future stock prices based on past prices.
Spoiler alert: the results show that this is actually not possible.

## Project structure

    .
    ├── requirements.txt  <- Required python packages 
    ├── analises          <- Where all the code is saved.
    └── dados             <- Folder where data resides.

## Contents

All the code is stored in a jupyter notebook. Besides the tensorflow model building code,
I also provide functions to download and process stock prices data from Brazilian stock
market BOVESPA.
